# Mental Health Prediction : Tech Mindscape
Major goal of this project is to optimize treatment decision-making, increase the likelihood of positive outcomes, and improve the overall quality of mental healthcare, while attempting to find the best model to predict the treatment requirement by experimenting with various ML algorithms.

Additionally, the project aims at exploring and quantifying the mutual influences between features like age, physical health factors and mental health treatment, which is achieved by conducting exhaustive analysis of every feature and visualizing the correlation.
